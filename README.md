# MCMSP
Official Minecraft Meme Soundpack repository

  MCMSP is a minecraft resourcepack aimed at changing minecraft sound effects for a more enjoyable experience.

  Audio files are stored in the .ogg format following the minecraft directory structure. The only sound files to strictly adhere to 
  minecraft naming conventions are the ones outside of the "mob" and "random" folders. I found that you cannot overwrite such sound effects through
  sounds.json . Among such odities one stands out the most: The Drowned. It is the only mob whose file structure I had to replicate strictly for it
  to work (modifiying sound strings through the .json file didn't work in this case) on the VANILLA version of the game ( .json editing worked for
  Optifine versions of the game).
